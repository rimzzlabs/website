        When I was a kid, I have dreamed of becoming a pilot, but things started to change when my
        father gave me a smartphone.

        possible for us to connect with people far away from us

        So I just started over and started learing programming, I was learning Java back then, which
        was also one of the courses of my class at my high school. It was awesome experience. She
        teaches me about basic programming like, loop, condition, class, function, even OOP.

        Fun fact, most of the female teachers are <em>&quot;fine&quot;</em> IYKWIM.
