      <p class='text-neutral-400 font-medium'>
        I did not have a computer back then, so learning programming is only possible when I am at
        the school.
      </p>

      <p class='text-neutral-400 font-medium'>
        So I started to get a job on social media, trying to do everyhting I can to get paid, like
        following airdrop campaign.
      </p>

      <p class='text-neutral-400 font-medium'>
        After a few months of hardwork doing small this and that. I finally got my first computer
        desktop. Yes! you read it right, I built my own computer desktop with the help of youtube.
        It is incredible how the internet work, right?.
      </p>

      <p class='text-neutral-400 font-medium'>
        But the obstacle did not stop here, I have the computer now, but now I do not have a proper
        internet connection. You see, -I live in the mountain foot of Pulosari, It is a countryside,
        Internet Service Provider has not reached our area yet.
      </p>

      <p class='text-neutral-400 font-medium'>
        So in order to learn programming on youtube, I leave my town and find a coffe shop that has
        Wi-Fi connection, and downloaded all youtube videos about programming, and then watch it
        locally at home.

      <p class='text-neutral-400 font-medium'>
        That is how a <em>self-taught-poor-countryside-boy</em>
        <strong>(me)</strong> learned programming.
