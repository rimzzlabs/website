					New Challenges, New Opportunities, and University Graduation
				</TimelineSubHeading>

				<TimelineText>
					In late 2023, I began exploring new interests in crypto, web3, and cryptocurrency trading.
					I reached out to a friend who had been working in this field for years to learn how things
					worked and expand my knowledge into these emerging areas. By February 2024, I decided to
					resign from Skyshi Digital Indonesia to pursue new opportunities.
				</TimelineText>

				<TimelineText>
					Coincidentally, the next day, a friend introduced me to Bitwyre , a company specializing
					in cryptocurrency, web3, and crypto trading. I applied immediately, went through
					interviews with their CTO and CEO, and was accepted as a Software Engineer (Frontend) on
					their Engineering team. It was fascinating how an area of personal interest became the
					field I now work in professionally.
				</TimelineText>

				<TimelineText>
					My first few months at Bitwyre involved adapting to a vastly different company culture. As
					a diverse organization with employees from around the world, fromCanada, America, India,
					Europe, and more, it was a unique environment. Despite English being my third language, it
					didn&apos;t hinder collaboration across continents.

					By late 2024, I graduated from university, marking the end of a three-year journey. While
					the institution I attended may not compare in size or prestige to larger universities like
					Gadjah Mada or the University of Indonesia, the experience I gained was invaluable. Time
					flew by, and though the academic environment wasnâ€™t overwhelming, it gave me the
