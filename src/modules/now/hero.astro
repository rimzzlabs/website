      Most websites have an &quot;about&quot; link that leads to a page sharing
      background information about the person or business, often called an
      &quot;about page.&quot; Similarly, there's usually a &quot;contact&quot;
      link directing visitors to details on how to reach out, known as a
      &quot;contact page.&quot; Likewise, some websites feature a
      &quot;now&quot; link, which takes you to a page describing what the person
      is currently focusing on in their life, and this is simply referred to as
      a &quot;now page.&quot;
