      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        Software engineering allows me to do meaningful work that aligns with my values. I can
        contribute to the greater good.
      </p>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        Software engineering means building software in a structured way: plan the layout, use the
        right materials, and make sure it's safe and functional.
      </p>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        There's room to innovate and think outside the box. Building software that improves lives or
        simplifies processes is rewarding.
      </p>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        The technology field is moving fast, so there's always something new to learn. This growth
        keeps things interesting.

      <SubTitle className='pb-4 text-start'> What&apos;s UI Engineer? </SubTitle>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        I mostly work in the Frontend Ecosystem, whether it&apos;s web applications, or mobile
        applications. Though I'm mostly into the web ecosystem, especially <ExternalLink
          href='https://react.dev'>React</ExternalLink
        >.
      </p>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        I use React because (so far) to me, it&apos;s one of the tool that <em>makes sense</em>
        to build functional user interfaces. It&apos;s just a simple JavaScript function that returns
        HTML (JSX) and then renders it on the page.
      </p>

      <p class='5 pb-2'>Let&apos;s back to the question: What&apos;s UI Engineer?</p>

      <p class='py-2.5'>
        To sum it up, it's a job where you develop and maintain cross-platform apps based on
        <strong>user-centered design</strong>. And as an engineer, I should be able to think and act
        like a real user.
      </p>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        In short; <strong>here&apos;s how it works</strong>: I am going to demand a nice piece of
        user interface, excellent user experience, smooth transition, and so on.
      </p>

      <p class='pb-2.5'>
        because here&apos;s what they might think: <strong
          >&quot;while using your product, you should serve us well, and if you did not served us
          well, I&apos;m just gonna buy it from another place&quot;</strong

        I progressively learn new things and keep myself up to date with the latest trends in
        technology. While keeping myself sane with black coffee.

      <p>
        Apart from my main job, I like to travel in search of nature, ride my motorbike, talk to my
        cats, and sometimes read philosophical books.
