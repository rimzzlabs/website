## Introduction

Analytics are a good tool to monitor the traffic on our websites, such as page views and visitors.

Take, for example, a blog about technology. Every person who visits the page is recorded, including where they came from _(e.g., Indonesia)_ and what web browser they used _(e.g., Chrome)_.

When it comes to analytics, you might think about **Google Analytics**, which is a web analytics tool offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic, but you are alsotired of being tracked by huge companies? I'm joking.

Then [Umami](https://umami.is 'umami official website') may might the answer for you. Umami is a simple, fast, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics; let's look at how we can use this platform to monitor our website activities.

### Requirements

Before we continue, we should first prepare the necessary _environment_ for Umami:

- A server with Node.js 12 or newer - we are going to use [vercel](https://vercel.com 'vercel official website')
- A database **_(MySQL or Postgresql)_** - we are going to use [supabase](https://supabase.com 'supabase official website')

## Setup Database

Before getting to Umami itself, let's create a database on supabase.

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/ 'supabase platform') is an open source alternative to [Firebase](https://firebase.com/), a collection of tools that helps developers build projects more quickly by automatically handling a whole lot of the behind-the-scenes work and wiring.

So let's just jump right into it!.

### Create Supabase Account

Lets create an account on [Supabase](https://supabase.com 'Supabase official website'), and then initialize a **New Project**.

![Supabase Project](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/supabase-1.png 'Supabase Project')

Supabase will asks for some information, we need to fill in the fields, and then click **Create New Project**.

![Supabase form field](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/supabase-2.png 'Supabase form field')

We will only use the database tool, so we need to focus more on it.

> Fill in the forms fields based on your personal preferences, and then select the closest region to your area in the form field, in my case, Singapore are the closest region.

### Configuring Schema

We need to configure the database schema on the supabase project.

![sql editor](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/supabase-3.png "Supabase's SQL Editor")

On the project dashboard, there is a tool that helps us create a new query on the database, let's go ahead to the sidebar menu, and select **SQL Editor**.

Let's copy and paste [this code](https://github.com/mikecao/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql 'PostgreSQL Schema') on the query field, and then **click run** to run query.

![Postgres Query](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/supabase-4.png 'Postgres Query')

The query simply create tables and wire up our database schema.

## Installing Umami

The next step are quite easy, we only need to setup some frontend environment and deploy umami to vercel.

> Make sure you have a vercel and github account.

### Setup And Deployment

We need to setup the Umami app on vercel, and then deploy it.

But first, we need the **Postgres Connection String**, let's go back to our supabase project, search for settings, and click **Database** menu on the left side.

Scroll down and search for **Connection string**, there would be a string that contains the database connection url.

![Postgre connection string](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/supabase-5.png 'Pg connection string')

As we are using vercel to deploy our Umami app, we need to use the **URI** connection, the URI string should be like this:

```bash
# PostgreSQL connection URI
"postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.********.*******.co:****/postgres"
```

But remember to modify the URI, change the `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` to your project password.

> Keep the URI secret!

Lets' go ahead and start deploying our umami app, fork [this repository](https://github.com/mikecao/umami 'umami repository'), and then go to vercel.

From the dashboard, there is a **New Project** button to create a new project, click to create a new project, choose the umami repository we've forked before.

Before we click the **Deploy** button, we need to configure the **Environment Variable**, expand the **Environment Variables** section.

![DATABASE_URL](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/vercel-1.png 'Supabase DB URL')

The first **Environment Variable** is `DATABASE_URL`, we need to fill in the **value** field with the **URI** string we just copied from our supabase project.

![HASH_SALT](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/vercel-2.png 'Hash Salt')

The second **Environment Variable** is `HASH_SALT`, it's just a random string, we can use [this website](https://genapass.vercel.app/ 'genpass') to generate random string, and then paste it to the **value** field.

Everything is ready, click **Deploy** button to deploy the Umami app.

### Change Umami Password

![Umami login page](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/umami-1.png 'Umami Login Page')

The app was deployed, we can visit the app now, the domain usually would act as subdomain of vercels' domain with our repository name, followed with `vercel.app`, e.g: `https://repo-name.vercel.app`.

And then we can change the password of the Umami app, the default password umami gave us is:

```bash
username: 'admin'
password: 'umami'
```

![Change umami password](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/umami-2.png 'Umami change password page')

Login to the umami app, and then click **Settings** -> **Profile**, there are a buton on top-right of the tab, click **change password** button.

### Linking Umami To Our Website

This is not finished yet, the last step is to link the Umami app to our website, so that umami can track our website.

We need to go to **settings** -> **websites** and add our website that we want to track, there will be a modal form asking for the **websites' name** and the **websites' domain**.

![Create website](https://ik.imagekit.io/mlnzyx/setup-umami/umami-3.png 'Umami target website to be tracked later')

The name fields are the name of our website, we can name it whatever we want, fill in the domain field with your website' domain that you want to monitor, e.g: `rizkicitra.dev`, and click **save**.

> The Enable share URL field is optional, this will let people could see our website traffic.

The website then saved, and the next step is to get the tracking code, let's head over to the **Settings** -> **Websites** and click the _link_ button to get the tracking code, the code should be like this:

```html
<script
  async
  defer
  data-website-id="some-random-string-or-the-websites-id-here"
  src="https://the-umami-you-deployed.com/umami.js"
></script>
```

The tracking code is an embed script that we can use to track our website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- other stuff... -->
    <script
      async
      defer
      data-website-id="some-random-string-or-the-websites-id-here"
      src="https://the-umami-you-deployed.com/umami.js"
    ></script>
    <!-- other stuff... -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- body section -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Head over to our websites codebase, and paste the **script tag** inside the **head** section of the website and we're set.

#### A Little Advice

If you are developing a website that based on JavaScript framework like [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org 'nextjs'), I recommend you to embed the script on the `_document.tsx` file, and embed the script conditionally.

This would prevent umami to track the website when you are developing the app on your local computer, like the following example below:

```tsx
// _document.tsx
import Document, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

export default class CustomDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang='en-US'>
        <Head>
          {/* other stuff here... */}

          {/* if the environment are in production,
          embed the script, otherwise do nothing at all */}
          {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && (
            <script
              async
              defer
              data-do-not-track='true'
              data-website-id='6daf05f5-92d2-430f-9cdd-1801014260da'
              src='https://umami.rizkicitra.dev/umami.js'
            />
          )}
          {/* other stuff here... */}
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
```

## Closing

That's all folks, the above setup can be used to any project, you just need to focus setting up umami and deploying it.

And then grab the embed script, thank you for reading this blog, wish you a good day, see you soon.
